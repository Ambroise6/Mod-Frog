# Mod-Frog
This project is a hobby project to convert an existing 3D printer to a “better” machine. Currently it’s based on the CoreXY principle https://www.corexy.org/theory.html
This project and me are not related  to the company; Leapfrog. I bought the machine at the beginning of 2015 and almost immediately started tinkering with it. 
There we’re multiple iteration on the design but it was never the intent to share these designs. So some designs are a bit of a mess but still usable.

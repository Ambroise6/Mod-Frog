This project is a hobby project to convert an existing 3D printer to a “better” machine. Currently it’s based on the CoreXY principle https://www.corexy.org/theory.html

This project and me are not related  to the company; Leapfrog. I bought the machine at the beginning of 2015 and almost immediately started tinkering with it. 

There we’re multiple iteration on the design but it was never the intent to share these designs. As a consequens the design files are a bit of a mess but still usable. If someone is willing to continue working a version please feel free and share it on this github. 

During the design proces a lot of inspiration came from other CoreXY systems like the Hypercube, S.T.E.V.E. & Voron designs. These and others printers we're and still are great design inspirations!

I'm  open for ideas and input on the  design so please feel free to comment and improve on the design :)

This current branch is filled with my previous designs, I'm currently working on Version 8 with carbon fibre rods and a Hemera.
